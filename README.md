## Project Overview

The Testimonials website showcases a collection of data, including people's images, names, job positions, and short information about them. The data is initially displayed with the default view showing the information at index zero, where my data is available.

## Features

- **Increment Button**: Clicking this button increments the index to view different people's information. When the last index is reached, it starts over from the first index.

- **Decrement Button**: Clicking this button decrements the index to view previous people's information. When index zero is reached, it starts from the last index.

- **Surprise Button**: This button displays random people's data from the dataset, providing a fun and unexpected experience.
